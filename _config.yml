  Graduating in Information Systems at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC).

  Full Stack Developer at Supero Tecnologia. Working with ReactS and NodeJS frameworks.

  Flexible, focused, patient and friendly professional. I am responsible and I like to work in teams with people who inspire me to offer the best I have. I seek new learning and moreover, I find it easy to adapt to new situations and work with all types of audiences. 

  I am passionate about software quality and I think when it comes to development, there is no better way to learn and work than being collaboratively ‚ù§.
