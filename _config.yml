user_description: >
  Graduating in Information Systems at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC).

  Quality Assurance Analyst at Supero Tecnologia. Web developer in his spare time.

  Flexible, focused, patient and friendly professional. I am responsible and I like to work in teams with people who inspire me to offer the best I have. I seek new learning and moreover, I find it easy to adapt to new situations and work with all types of audiences. 

  I am passionate about software quality and I think when it comes to development, there is no better way to learn and work than being collaboratively ‚ù§. 

  I have knowledge in planning and execution of test scenarios and development in HTML5, CSS3, JAVA, Javascript and some of their frameworks like ReactJS.
