user_description: >
  Undergraduate Student in Information Systems at the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC).
  Quality Assurance Intern at Bridge Lab. Web developer in his spare time. 
  Flexible, focused, patient and friendly professional. I am responsible and I like to work in teams with people who inspire me to offer the best I have. I seek new learning and moreover, I find it easy to adapt to new situations and work with all types of audiences. 
  I am passionate about software quality and I think when it comes to development, there is no better way to learn and work than being collaboratively ><. 
  I have experience in planning and execution of test scenarios and have some knowledge with development in HTML5, CSS3, JAVA, Javascript and some of its frameworks as ReactJS.
